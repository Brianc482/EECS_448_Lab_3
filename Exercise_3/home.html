	My name is Brian Clark, and I am currently enrolled in the School of Engineering at The University of Kansas.<br>
		I love technology, and learning in general, but learning about new technologies, and their possible applications is my favorite.<br>
		I have successfully obtained the following degrees from Johnson County Community College, while in pursuit of my Bachelor of Computer Science:
	<br>

	<ul class="b">
		<li>Associates of Arts, Liberal Arts</li>
		<li>Associates of Science, General Sciences</li>
	    <li>Associates of General Studies</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In the modern world in which we live, society is becoming ever more dependent upon technology, the ability to communicate, and how to securely share information in a dynamic and changing environment.
	The primary focus of my degree has been on cyber security, web services, and web technology.
	I believe this focus makes me an invaluable asset in a multitude of ways to any organization!</p><br>
